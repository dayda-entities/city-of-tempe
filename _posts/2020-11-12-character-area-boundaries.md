<p>The Character Area Boundaries layer shows the areas or groups of neighborhoods that contain common design, land use and commercial characteristics distinct from neighboring areas. Similarities in age of housing, styles of architecture, patterns of development, materials, land use or street patterns, lot size, landscaping, landmarks, social magnets, and/or physical barriers form some of the recognizable differences.</p><p>Contact: Will Duke</p><p><a href='mailto:will_duke@tempe.gov'>Contact E-mail</a></p><p>Contact Phone: 480-350-8690</p><p>Link: N/A</p><p>Data Source: ArcGIS Server</p><p>Data Source Type: Geospatial</p><p>Preparation Method: N/A</p><p>Publish Frequency: As information changes</p><p>Publish Method: Automatic</p><p><a href='https://gis.tempe.gov/character-dictionary'>Data Dictionary</a></p>
