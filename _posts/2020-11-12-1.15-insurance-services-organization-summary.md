<p>ISO is an independent advisory organization that collects information on a community's building-code adoption and enforcement services in order to provide a ranking for insurance companies. ISO assigns a Building Code Effectiveness Classification from 1 to 10 based on the data collected. Class 1 represents exemplary commitment to building-code enforcement.</p><p><br /></p><p>Municipalities with better rankings are lower risk, and their residents' insurance rates can reflect that. The prospect of minimizing catastrophe-related damage and ultimately lowering insurance costs gives communities an incentive to enforce their building codes rigorously.</p><p><br /></p><p>This page provides data for the Insurance Services Organization (ISO) performance measure. </p><p><br /></p><p>This data includes residential and commercial building code enforcement ratings for the City of Tempe.</p><p><br /></p><p>The performance measure dashboard is available at <a href='https://safe-and-secure-communities-tempegov.hub.arcgis.com/pages/insurance-services-organization-iso-rating' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>1.15 Insurance Services Organization (ISO) Rating</a></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Additional Information</b></p><p><br /></p><p>Source: Insurance Service Organization Rating</p><p>Contact: Chris Thompson</p><p>Contact E-Mail: Christopher_Thompson@tempe.gov</p><p>Data Source Type: Excel</p><p>Preparation Method: Information added to Excel spreadsheet from rating report</p><p>Publish Frequency: Every 5 Years</p><p>Publish Method: Manual</p><p><a href='https://gis.tempe.gov/design/data-dictionary/1.15%20Insurance%20Services%20Organization%20(summary)/' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>Data Dictionary</a><br /></p>
