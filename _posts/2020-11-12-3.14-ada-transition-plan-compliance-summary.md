<div>The City of Tempe ADA Transition Plan has been developed so the City can identify and work toward removing obstacles that limit access by people with disabilities to its programs, activities and services as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. These regulations require, among other things, the following: 1) An inventory of barriers; 2) A schedule for removing the barriers; and, 3) A description of the methods to be used to remove the barriers.  The City of Tempe has chosen to use a three phase approach to accomplish the self-evaluation, schedule development, and method of barrier removal. The first phase includes the evaluation, prioritization and cost estimating for the public right-of-way, ten parks, several parking lots and on-street parking in the downtown area. Phase II will include the majority of the remaining right-of-way, parks and the emergency management program.  Phase III will finish the public right-of-ways and the parks and buildings that are open to the public.<br /></div><div><div> </div><div>This performance measure uses the inventory of barriers and the inventory of repairs as metrics.  Dividing the repairs by the total inventory of barriers yields the measurement.    </div></div><div><br /></div><div>This page provides data for the ADA Transition Plan performance measure.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div>The performance measure dashboard is available at <a href='https://quality-of-life-tempegov.hub.arcgis.com/pages/ada-transition-plan' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>3.14 ADA Transition Plan Compliance</a>.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><b>Additional Information</b><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Source: </div><div><br /></div><div>Contact: Aaron Peterson</div><div><br /></div><div>Contact E-Mail: Aaron_Peterson@tempe.gov</div><div><br /></div><div>Data Source Type: Table</div><div><br /></div><div>Preparation Method: Departments responsible for the repairs indicate when a repair has been completed.
