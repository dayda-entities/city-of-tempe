<div><div>As a commitment to sustainability, our city joined the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy. Tempe is setting a path to sustainability and resilience with our first ever Climate Action Plan (CAP). This CAP serves as a guideline for the City of Tempe’s path toward a sustainable and resilient future that will benefit the entire city. It is a detailed framework for measuring and reducing GHG emissions and climate change impacts. The CAP includes an inventory of previous years’ GHG emissions, Tempe’s emissions reduction goals, and prioritized actions. This dataset provides the community Greenhouse Gas emissions for the City of Tempe.   </div><div><br /></div><div>Community greenhouse gas emissions inventories are a way for cities to track community greenhouse gas emissions.  Currently, cities consume over two thirds of the world's energy and account for more than 70% of global CO2 emissions. (ICLEI)  Tempe conducted a greenhouse gas inventory based on 2015 calendar year data to measure the community's greenhouse gas emissions.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>This page provides data for the Community Carbon Neutrality performance measure. </div><div><br /></div><div>The performance measure dashboard is available at <a href='https://sustainable-growth-and-development-tempegov.hub.arcgis.com/pages/community-carbon' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>4.18 Community Carbon Neutrality</a>.</div><div><b><br /></b></div><div><div><b>Additional Information</b></div><div><br /></div><div>Source: Various sources including municipal resources, APS, SRP, SW Gas, and Maricopa Association of Governments.</div><div>Contact (author): Grace Kelly </div><div>Contact E-Mail (author): Grace_Kelly@tempe.gov</div><div><div>Contact (maintainer): Braden Kay</div><div>Contact E-Mail (maintainer): Braden_Kay@tempe.gov</div></div><div>Data Source Type: Table</div><div>Preparation Method: Transportation, fuel and energy use data are collected from various sources for residential, commercial and industrial uses in the community and estimates of the amount of emissions are calculated using the ICLEI's ClearPath tool.</div><div>Publish Frequency: Every 5 years</div><div>Publish Method: Manual</div><div><a href='https://gis.tempe.gov/design/data-dictionary/4.18%20Community%20Carbon%20Neutrality/' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>Data Dictionary</a><br /></div></div>
