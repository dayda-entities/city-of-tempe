<p>Tempe’s roadways are an important means of transportation for residents, the workforce, students, and visitors. Tempe measures the quality and condition of its roadways using a Pavement Quality Index (PQI). This measure, rated from a low of 0 to a high of 100, is used by the City to plan for maintenance and repairs, and to allocate resources in the most efficient way possible.</p><p><br /></p><p>This measure is created using pavement quality data maintained in the RoadMatrix Pavement Management Program. About every three years, the City surveys pavement, such as the smoothness of roadways and any signs of distress in the pavement surface. This data is then used to calculate the PQI, which determines roadway maintenance prioritization schedules as well as the most optimal road treatment options (such as placing a filler material in the cracks and treating the entire pavement surface, milling and replacing the top layer of the asphalt pavement, reconstructing the street section)</p><p><br /></p><p>This page provides data for the performance measure related to PQI.  To access geospatial data regarding PQI please visit https://data.tempe.gov/dataset/pavement-quality-index-segments</p><p><br /></p><p>The performance measure dashboard is available at <a href='https://safe-and-secure-communities-tempegov.hub.arcgis.com/pages/pavement-quality-index' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>1.22 Pavement Quality Index</a></p><p><br /></p><p></p><p>This resource represents annual citywide average PQI.</p><p><br /></p><p>This resource is used in the indicators found in the Safe and Secure Communities dashboard.</p><p></p><p><br /></p><p></p><p><b>Additional Information</b></p><p><br /></p><p>Source: Stantec/Road Matrix</p><p>Contact (author): Isaac Chavira</p><p>Contact E-Mail (author): isaac_chavira@tempe.gov</p><p>Contact (maintainer): Sue Taaffe</p><p>Contact E-Mail (maintainer): sue_taaffe@tempe.gov</p><p>Data Source Type: CSV</p><p>Preparation Method: Extracted from Roadmatrix and joined to GIS network</p><p>Publish Frequency: Annual (Average PQI)/Quarterly (Segment PQI)</p><p>Publish Method: Manual</p><p><a href='https://gis.tempe.gov/design/data-dictionary/1.22%20PQI%20Average%20Citywide%20(summary)/' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>Data Dictionary</a><br /></p>
