<p>Zoning districts classify, regulate and restrict uses, as well as combine uses and encourage the location of compatible land uses close to one another. The district regulations provide development standards pertaining to the intensity of land uses and development, height and bulk of buildings and structures, and area of yards and other open areas between buildings and structures.</p><p>Contact: Robbie Aaron</p><p><a href='mailto:robbie_aaron@tempe.gov' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>Contact E-mail</a><br /></p><p>Contact Phone: 480-350-8690</p><p>Link: N/A</p><p>Data Source: ArcGIS Server</p><p>Data Source Type: Geospatial</p><p>Preparation Method: N/A</p><p>Publish Frequency: As information changes</p><p>Publish Method: Automatic</p><p><a href='https://gis.tempe.gov/zoning-dictionary' rel='nofollow ugc'>Data Dictionary</a></p>
