<p>This dataset comes from the Annual Community Survey question related to residents’ feeling of safety and their perceptions about their likelihood of becoming a victim of violent or property crimes. The fear of crime refers to the fear of being a victim of crime as opposed to the actual probability of being a victim of crime. The Annual Community Survey question that relates to this dataset is: “Please indicate how often you worry about each of the following: a) Getting mugged; b) Having your home burglarized when you are not there; c) Being attacked or threatened with a weapon; d) Having your car stolen or broken into; e) Being a victim of identity theft?” Respondents are asked to rate how often they worry about being a victim on a scale of 5 to 1, where 5 means “Frequently” and 1 means “Never” (without &quot;don't know&quot; as an option).</p><p><br /></p><p>This page provides details about the Worry About Being a Victim performance measure.
