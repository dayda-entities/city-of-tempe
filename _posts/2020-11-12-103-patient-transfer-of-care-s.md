<p>Data originates from stroke alerts made by Tempe Fire Medical Rescue where patients which showed symptoms of a stroke on scene and a stroke alert was activated with the receiving hospital. Total time is calculated from the Fire unit's initial contact with a patient at the scene to the time the patient arrived at the hospital.</p><p><br /></p><p>Data collection on stroke patients is collected through the Image Trend Elite electronic patient care reporting (ePCR) system. Stroke on-scene time reports are generated by the EMS Coordinator within the Medical Services section by utilizing the “report writer” system within the software to identify how long responders spend on-scene with the patient before departing to a stroke facility for treatment. Total on-scene time = unit departure time – unit arrival time.</p><p><br /></p><p>Values of 99999 and 99:99:99 indicate no data/unknown. </p><p><br /></p><p>The performance measure dashboard is available at <a href='https://safe-and-secure-communities-tempegov.hub.arcgis.com/pages/patient-transfer-of-care' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>1.03 Patient Transfer of Care</a><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Additional Information</b></p><p><br /></p><p>Source: Image Trend</p><p>Contact: Andrea Glass</p><p>Contact E-Mail: andrea_glass@tempe.gov</p><p>Data Source Type: CSV</p><p>Preparation Method: Report run on Image Trend, then exported to Excel</p><p>Publish Frequency: Annual</p><p>Publish Method: Manual</p><p><a href='https://gis.tempe.gov/design/data-dictionary/1.03%20Patient%20Transfer%20Stroke%20(detail%202016%20and%20earlier)%20DD/' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>Data Dictionary</a><br /></p>
