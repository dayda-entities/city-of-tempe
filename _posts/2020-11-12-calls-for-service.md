<p>The Calls for Service dataset includes police service requests for which patrol officers, traffic officers, bike officers and, on occasion, detectives will be dispatched to public safety response.  It also includes self-initiated calls for service where an officer witnesses a violation or suspicious activity for which they would respond.</p><p>Contact: Brooks Louton- Police Planning and Research Supervisor</p><p><a href='mailto:brooks_louton@tempe.gov' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>Contact E-mail</a><br /></p><p>Contact Phone: 480-350-8439</p><p>Link: N/A</p><p>Data Source: Versaterm Informix RMS - CADWSQL</p><p>Data Source Type: Informix and/or SQL Server</p><p>Preparation Method: Preparation Method: Automated View pulled from CADWSQL (SQL Server) and duplicated on the GIS Server</p><p>Publish Frequency: Daily</p><p>Publish Method: Automatic</p><p><a href='https://gis.tempe.gov/cfs-dictionary' rel='nofollow ugc'>Data Dictionary</a></p>
