<p>The Customer Relations Center (CRC) or Tempe 311 is often the first and possibly only contact a resident has with the City. Our goal is to make each interaction as smooth and efficient as possible. To efficiently provide our residents an improved level of customer service, Tempe 311 strives to serve our residents by acting as the central connection to accessible information and government services. Our purpose is realized through our ability to resolve calls with a single point of contact. When we do this, we have met 311’s mission and provided effective customer service. Tempe 311 CRC strives to achieve Single Point of Contact (SPOC) resolution rate greater than or equal to 75% of incoming calls.</p><p><br /></p><p>This page provides data for the 311 First-Call Resolution Rate performance measure.</p><p><br /></p><p>The performance measure dashboard is available at <a href='https://strong-community-connections-tempegov.hub.arcgis.com/pages/311-first-call-resolution-rate' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>2.03 311 First-Call Resolution Rate</a>.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p></p><p><b>Additional Information</b></p><p>Source:</p><p>Contact: Moncayo, Kim</p><p>Contact E-Mail: Kim_Moncayo@tempe.gov</p><p>Data Source Type: Accela CRM, Excel, Cisco Unified Intelligence</p><p>Preparation Method: The data from every 311 call is entered into the city's Accela CRM database system.
