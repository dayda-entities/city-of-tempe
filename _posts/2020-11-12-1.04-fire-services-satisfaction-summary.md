<p>The Tempe Fire Medical Rescue Department (TFMR) is an “all hazards” department that responds to all types of calls for service. The City of Tempe collects data from an annual Community Survey and the monthly TFMR Customer Service Survey to gauge resident perceptions about the quality and satisfaction of city services, programs and direction. The survey results help to determine priorities for the community as part of the City's ongoing strategic management process.</p><p><br /></p><p>This page provides data for the Fire Services Satisfaction performance measure. </p><p><br /></p><p>The performance measure dashboard is available at <a href='https://safe-and-secure-communities-tempegov.hub.arcgis.com/pages/fire-services-satisfaction' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>1.04 Fire Services Satisfaction</a></p><p><br /></p><p><b>Additional Information </b></p><p><br /></p><p>Source: Community Attitude Survey</p><p>Contact:  Wydale Holmes </p><p>Contact E-Mail:  wydale_holmes@tempe.gov</p><p>Data Source Type:  Excel</p><p>Preparation Method:  Data received from vendor (Community Survey)</p><p>Publish Frequency:  Annual</p><p>Publish Method:  Manual</p><p><a href='https://gis.tempe.gov/design/data-dictionary/1.04%20Fire%20Services%20Satisfaction%20(summary)/' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>Data Dictionary</a> </p>
